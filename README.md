# exercise-1
This project is an implementation of a StringBuilder class in pure JavaScript. This class is designed to manipulate strings, with included methods that allow for appending, prepending, and padding of the string content.

It not only demonstrates the ability to create classes and manipulate data in pure JavaScript, but also serves as an educational resource. The implementation is explained to provide understanding for those seeking to learn and understand the concept of class creation in JavaScript.
